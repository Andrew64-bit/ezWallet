# Project Estimation - CURRENT
Date: 14 april 2023

Version: 1


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |        4                     |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |        80                   | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 320|
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                      32           |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 960| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |           1         |

# Summary

The results differ because diffrent approaces may lead to diffrent results.
Focusing on estimating little task (as for the decomposition approach) may lead to better results.
